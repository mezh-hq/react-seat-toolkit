<h1>Customization</h1>

<h4>React Seat Toolkit is highly customizable. You can change almost every aspect of it through its `styles` prop</h4>

<h4>Here is an example of how you can override its default styles:</h4>

```jsx
import { SeatToolkit } from "@mezh-hq/react-seat-toolkit";

return <SeatToolkit 
  mode="designer"
  styles={{
    root: {
      className: "bg-gray-100",
      style: {
        padding: "20px",
        borderRadius: "10px",
        boxShadow: "0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```
