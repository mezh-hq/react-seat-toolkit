<h1>Modifying State</h1>

<h4>React Seat Toolkit uses Redux to manage its state. You can modify its state using the underlying `store` itself or a couple of abstracted `actions` which are available to you.</h4>

<h4>Here is an example of how you can deselect a seat manually and retrieve the updated state:</h4>

```tsx
import { actions } from "@mezh-hq/react-seat-toolkit";

actions.deselectElement("<seat-id>");

const state = actions.getState();

console.log(state); // Updated workspace state of type STKData
```

<h4>Here is an example of how you can import and use the `store` to retrieve the current Redux state:</h4>

```tsx
import { store } from "@mezh-hq/react-seat-toolkit";

const state = store.getState();

console.log(state); // Current redux state (Not of type STKData)
```

<h4>For a full list of supported actions please have a look at its type definitions</h4>
